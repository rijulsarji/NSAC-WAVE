# Sleep Shifting Scheduling Tool

As students of SRMIST, we are participating in the Aarush hackathon. We have decided to pick the topic of Sleep Schedule Shifting Tool. Our idea is create a combination of everything, which also includes 7 hours of sleep, for every kind of person out there.We ask the user some questions, related to their sleep cycle, their health and  other criteria, and based on that, we will suggest a time table for the person. For example, a student will be suggested to sleep for 7 hours straight between 11 p.m.and 6 a.m., whereas the timetable to sleep for an old person will be slightly earlier, and for a heart patient, the sleep timing will be be different. Our main aim is to provide a person a comfortable sleep schedule that could be adjusted in different conditions, and also benefits the person both physically and mentally. We will use python language to make the application. We will compare the conditions given by the user with that in our database, and help the user by providing a suitable sleep time table.
